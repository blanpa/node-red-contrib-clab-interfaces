version: '3.8'

# This docker-compose configuration uses host networking mode
# which allows the container to see the actual host network interfaces
# and their real IP addresses (not Docker bridge IPs).
#
# Use this for:
# - Accessing real network interfaces (eth0, wlan0, etc.)
# - Seeing actual host IP addresses
# - Bluetooth, WiFi configuration
# - Network diagnostics
#
# Note: Port mapping is not needed in host mode as the container
# uses the host's network stack directly.
